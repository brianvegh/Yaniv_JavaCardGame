# Yaniv, "The Traveler's Game" - GUI Card Game with JavaFX
Yaniv (pronounced Ya·ahn·eve) is a GUI based java application that allows a single player to play a card game against 3 Computer players. Yaniv, also known throughout the middle and near east as the traveler’s card game, is a complex game which is similar to rummy. Players participate in rounds; the goal of each is to hold the lowest number of points before declaring “Yaniv!” The player with the least points receives a score of zero for that round; all other players receive the cumulative value of their hand. As players exceed a specified point value (usually 200), they are eliminated. The last player remaining is the victor.
